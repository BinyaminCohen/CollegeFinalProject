In software development, change is an integral part in the routine of a software life cycle.
Program must reform its functionality – add new features, improve existing ones, fix bugs
and boost performance. Those changes, don’t skip over software libraries dependencies,
which are commonly used nowadays to enhance processes and improve productivity.
These utilities are provided by libraries to clients via Application Programming Interfaces
(API). However, the management of software updates has become a serious challenge for
modern organizations. As the technology landscape has evolved, using a variety of libraries
does not facilitate the process. For many businesses, upgrading project’s dependencies
has become a time consuming and irritating task. While some versions updates can be
installed easily, others may include “API breaking changes” meaning a human intervention
is required to adjust the corresponding changes. In other words, “API breaking changes”
refers to an API that breaks backward compatibility through removal or modification of API
elements. In this project, our goal is to turn the above-mentioned upgrading to a simpler
and efficient procedure, by automating the updating of project’s dependencies. We develop
an algorithm that identifies API breaking changes in source code and is able to repair those
changes, through a generic set of rules of API breaking changes. From our research, there
are currently a few tools for upgrading specific version in a certain library. In addition, there
are softwares for automated refactoring, however creating a new rule is neither possible nor
convenient. Therefore, this project’s objective is to create a user-friendly solution that is
compatible with all libraries in a certain technology. This project will be a step towards
automating the software migration process, it will reduce viability considerations in the
update and allow safe transformation with minimum effort by developers.
